## Requirements

Python v3.7

#### Q1:   
- Tensorflow
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib


# Question 1

Code can be found in the 'Part1/' directory. 

To test Q1.1 & Q1.2 run,

```

python Part1/Q1.py

```

OR  

You can also view, training.ipynb to view the completed process - For some odd reason the Model Plots did not want to display in the notebook - So we created a notebook to display the plot_model results.


For Q1.3 the code can be found in patches.ipynb - This displays the patches for 'Model 5'.

All Saves can be found in 'Part1/Model/{i}/'.
