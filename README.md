# Question 1

Code can be found in the 'Part1/' directory. 

Q1.py is the same code as train.ipynb.

To test Q1.1 & Q1.2 run,

```

python Part1/Q1.py

```

**OR**

You can also view, training.ipynb to view the completed process - For some odd reason the Model Plots did not want to display in the notebook - So we created a notebook to display the plot_model results.


For Q1.3 the code can be found in patches.ipynb - This displays the patches for 'Model 5'.

All Saves can be found in 'Part1/Model/{i}/'.


# Question 2

Code can be found in the 'Part2/' directory. 

Part 2.2 can be found in character_level_rnn.ipynb.

Part 2.3 can be found in 2.3.ipynb.

All Saved Models are in "Part2/Models/model_{id}.pt"
